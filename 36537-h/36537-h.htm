<h2>THE 'EAT OF DISCUSSION.</h2>

<h3>(<i>A Fancy founded on Facts.</i>)</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> left the court with his colleagues at
twenty minutes to one o'clock. He said
nothing, but listened intently while the
question of the Inquest was canvassed.
Was it to be a verdict of Manslaughter or
Murder, or only Accidental Death? He
listened so intently that he was quite surprised
when the clock struck two.</p>

<p>Yes two o'clock&mdash;time for his lunch!</p>

<p>He rose from his seat, and went to the door.
He spoke to one on the other side, he talked
of cuts from the joints, and chops and steaks.</p>

<p>He was answered with laughter!</p>

<p>Then he returned to his chair, rather put
out at this ill-timed pleasantry, and listened
once more to the arguments of his colleagues.
They had got beyond the verdict now, and
were discussing the "riders." The first,
elaborately blaming the Magistrates, had
been framed and passed, and the second
dealing with the bye-laws of the Town
Council was under consideration. Before it
was finally settled the clock struck three!</p>

<p>Yes, three! and since twenty-minutes to
one he had been locked in lunchless! He
went to the door and beat it with his fists!</p>

<p>"Might he have a cut off the joint?"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>Again he was silent, and again his colleagues
continued their discussion. They
spoke in lower tones now, because they too
were feeling the want of food. Four struck,
and then five.</p>

<p>He staggered once more to the door, and in
piteous tones made a last request,</p>

<p>Might he have a sandwich?</p>

<p>No!!!!!</p>

<p>It was too much! He ground his teeth in
rage! Five hours had elapsed, and then the
last and eighth rider, suggesting that after
its final completion a theatre should be
thrown open for public inspection for a week
before a licence was granted, was passed.
The work of the Jury was over.</p>

<p>It was indeed a painful scene. The eleven
men who had taken part in the discussion
were entirely exhausted. Some were slumbering
from weakness, others were wearily
"talking on their fingers." Hunger had
made these last absolutely dumb. Reams of
papers were scattered about covered with
writing. Here and there was a quill-pen
partly consumed. Even the blotting-pads
testified to the presence of hungry men&mdash;some
of the leaves showed the traces of a
stealthy nibble. In the heat of argument
hours before, a juryman, anxious to impress
an opinion upon a sceptic colleague, had
offered to "eat his hat." He now gazed at
the head-gear with greedy eyes, as if anxious
to carry out his proposition.</p>

<p>The Foreman, in a whisper, asked if anyone
had any further suggestions to make.</p>

<p>Then the rage of the starving one gave
him fictitious strength. He stood up, and
shrieked out, "I express my opinion that the
non-supply of refreshments to the Jury for
several hours is a blot on the legal system of
the country!"</p>

<p>In a moment the Foreman and his colleagues
sprang to their feet, and, making a
supreme effort, shouted out, "Agreed!
agreed! agreed!"</p>

<p>And what further did these poor famished
men, these heroes of the long, foodless day,
these martyrs to a cruel system&mdash;a wretched
system&mdash;these victims to an abuse that
should be swept away like chaff before the
wind&mdash;ay, what farther did they do after
their trumpet-tongued cry of indignant denunciation?</p>

<p>Why (it is to be sincerely hoped) that they
went home and had their dinner!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Mandarin had an only daughter, named <span class="smcap">Li-Chi</span>, who fell in love
with <span class="smcap">Chang</span>, a young man who lived in the island-home represented at the
top of the pattern, and who had been her father's secretary. The father
overheard them one day making vows of love under the orange-tree, and
sternly forbade the unequal match; but the lovers contrived to elope, lay
concealed for awhile in the gardener's cottage, and thence made their escape
in a boat to the island-home of the young lover. The enraged Mandarin
pursued them with a whip, and would have beaten them to death, had not
the gods rewarded their fidelity by changing them both into turtle-doves.
The picture is called the Willow-Pattern, not only because it is a tale of
disastrous love, but because the elopement occurred 'when the willow begins
to shed its leaves.'"&mdash;<i>Legend of the Willow-Pattern.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>that of the tradition. Season, willow-fall. Hour, sundown.</i></p>

<p><i>Li-Chi</i> (<i>sings</i>)&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The poor soul sat sighing by a rum-looking tree,</p>
<p class="i2">Sing, once a green willow;</p>
<p>But now all its leaves smell of base £ <i>s.</i> <i>d.</i>;</p>
<p class="i2">Sing willow, willow, willow!</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>The old stream runs by her, not with the old tones,</p>

<p>But, churned by coarse paddles, it plashes and groans;</p>
<p class="i2">Sing willow, willow, willow!</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><i>Chang.</i> Ah, yellow and irradiant sunflower of my soul's secret
shrine, sing not thus dolefully, I entreat thee. What avails the
permission to escape awhile our old ornithological metamorphosis,
and revisit once again the glimpses of the Mandarin's country seat,
the pavilion, the peach and the orange-tree, the elegant wooden
fence, the bridge, the boat, and, above all, the willow, only to sing
songs whose spirit-cleaving cadences sting thy <span class="smcap">Chang</span> more than
ever did the angry Mandarin's whip-lash?</p>

<p><i>Li-Chi (mournfully).</i> What, indeed? But O, sublimated saffron-bag
of my spirit's idolatry, who can help weeping at sight of <i>this</i>?</p>

<p><i>Chang (reading).</i> "National and International Amalgamated
Bank!" O, mighty but much-too-free-with-the-whip-hand-of-parental-authority
Mandarin of the Middle Kingdom, what would
you have thought of this transformation?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg 147]</span>
<i>Li-Chi.</i> Papa was impetuous. Our&mdash;our
elopement angered him. But Telegraph-poles,
Telephone Exchanges, River Steamers,
Banks and Blazing Posters!!&mdash;Alas!!!</p>

<p><i>Chang (hotly).</i> By the isolated button of
Celestial supereminence, it is too bad!
What <i>can</i> <span class="smcap">Li Hung Chang</span>, that dragon-claw
of the throne, that amber-souled prop
of imperial perpendicularity be about, I
wonder?</p>

<p><i>Li-Chi (meditatively).</i> We&mdash;e&mdash;ell,&mdash;perhaps
he knows, after all.</p>

<p><i>Chang.</i> What meaneth the tintinnabulant
tea-blossom of my trivial and ephemeral
personality?</p>

<p><i>Li-Chi (archly).</i> The "Heathen Chinee,"
as the wanton Western scribe insolently calls
him, is indeed "peculiar," as perchance even
Count <span class="smcap">Eugene Stanislow Kostka de Mitkiewicz</span>
and Mr. <span class="smcap">Jay-Gould</span>, <span class="smcap">Hood</span>, <span class="smcap">Mackay</span>
the multi-millionnaire, and <span class="smcap">Barker</span> Brothers
the Bankers, New York Syndicates and
Philadelphian Silver Rings, may yet discover
as clearly and completely as did <i>Bill Nye</i>
and <i>Truthful James</i> of the ribald ballad.</p>

<p><i>Chang (admiringly).</i> Verily even the
orbicular contractility of dexter-optical
semi-closure becometh those almond eyes,
oh! flesh-enshrined opium-ecstasy of my
most transcendental inwardness.</p>

<p><i>Li-Chi (smartly).</i> I should think it did,
indeed! A wink is as good as a nod to a
blind lover. "Melican Man" is very 'cute
and enterprising; but whether he'll find it
quite so easy as he fancies to "run" the
Celestial Kingdom, or "exploit" the
Flowery Land, remains as the never-sufficiently-to-be-commended-and-left-carefully-unread
<span class="smcap">Kung-foo-tze</span> would say, "to
be duskily adumbrated in the spirit-speculum
of the yet To-be."</p>

<p><i>Chang.</i> Quite so. Still, O million-berried
mulberry-tree of my mean and inconsiderable
soul-garden, to have our own secular
love-legend and its many-centuried Scene
thus sordidly transmogrified, cannot, O,
shining one of my spirit's crepuscular gloom.
O, beneficent betel-nut of my supersensual
Palate"&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Li-Chi.</i> Well, <span class="smcap">Chang</span>, after all, novelty
hath its charm&mdash;after a cycle or two, you
know. Marquis <span class="smcap">Tseng</span> talks about "the
awakening of China." As if there was ever
a Celestial who, for all his childlikeness and
blandness, was not very wide-awake indeed!
Why, <span class="smcap">Li-Chi</span>, if ever <i>we</i> had our time over
again, <i>do</i> you think that transmutation into
a pair of turtle-doves,&mdash;bird-beatitudes, my
<span class="smcap">Chang</span>, are <i>so</i> limited!&mdash;would form the
acme of our mutual aspirations?</p>

<p><i>Chang.</i> Well, per&mdash;haps not, <span class="smcap">Li-Chi</span>.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Better fifty years of Europe</p>
<p>Than a Cycle of Cathay,&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>&mdash;as turtle-doves, you know. Still, that
chuckling and cavorting American fowl,
that two-headed and vulturine Russo-Polish
Eagle, do not quite fit into the Mongolian
Arcadia of the Willow-pattern plate; now
do they? We have fallen, lily of my life,
upon sordid, and subversive, and sceptical
times, when millions of taels move our
Mandarins to Modernism, when Silver
Rings and Syndicates, can set up a Party
of Progress in the Realm of the Immutable,
and when doubts have been thrown by
shallow scribes upon the existence of the
Great Wall of China itself!</p>

<p><i>Li-Chi (shuddering).</i> Dreadful, dear!
Let's turn back into turtle-doves at once,
and coo ourselves into truly Celestial
obliviousness of this colossal Yankee <i>coup</i>,
which threatens&mdash;perchance prematurely&mdash;to
fix for all time <i>this</i> preposterously Western
and barbaric picture as the Willow Pattern

<h2>"PAYING THEIR SHOT."</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A Party</span> of excursionists from the Tyne thought it a pleasant way of spending a Bank-holiday
to go wantonly shooting swarms of sea-birds on the Farne Islands. When remonstrated
with by the more humane man in charge, they considered it still greater "sport" to
threaten to push an oar down his throat, and make a target of him. These sportive souls
indeed managed amongst them to "hit his felt hat and graze his left thumb" with shot.
But when 239 of them were summoned under the Wild Birds Act, and had to pay fines and
expenses to the tune of some £70, they probably modified their notion of the nature and claim
of "Sport," and found that "paying the shot" in that sense was the least pleasant part of
shooting. Some of them were probably left without "a shot in the locker." A few more
such wholesome lessons, and the "Cad with a Gun," the "Brute with a Double-Barrel,"
may no longer be found depopulating Nature's feathered preserves and disgracing the
name of honest Sport.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> last I have seen him!&mdash;the travelling Englishman, the English
Milord of the French Farce&mdash;"Oah, c'est moa!" of the <i>Journal
Comique</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>But if the farce Milord is grotesque, the English "Mees" is equally
ridiculous. I met, the other day, a lady of Albion, who was strutting
about with an enormous "handled"

eyes, while she expressed
her opinion
"that those foreigners

<p><i>Diary of a Day.</i>&mdash;At
all these Stations
Thermales the pleasantest
hours of the
day are sacrificed to
the interests of the
band, the casinos, the
cercle, and the evening
amusements. <i>Les
Baigneurs sérieux</i>
ought not to require
any amusement after
9·30, and by ten they
should be in bed.
Their hours for walking
and other exercise
should be very early
in the morning, or late in the evening before dinner. The remainder
of the day should be given up to baths, to drinking waters, <i>déjeuner
à la fourchette</i>, and rest.</p>

</div>

<hr class="short" />

<p>By the way, at the top of the daily menu at the Continental Hotel
the <i>déjeuner à la fourchette</i> at 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> is styled "<span class="smcap">Lunch</span>." <span class="smcap">Puller</span>
resents this as strongly as he does a waiter's answering him, "Yees,
Sare," when he has given an order in his best French. Now this
meal at 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> is not an English lunch, but is the French <i>déjeuner
à la fourchette</i>. Is it becoming the common practice in hotels on
the Continent? If so, the English will soon remember that they
don't come abroad for lunch&mdash;they can "lunch" well enough at
home&mdash;but they do come abroad for <i>déjeuner à la fourchette</i>, and, if
they do not get it, they will stay away.</p>

<p>"It's confoundedly insulting!" exclaims <span class="smcap">Puller</span>, indignantly.
"Do they think we don't know what a <i>déjeuner à la fourchette</i>
means? But, dash it, you know," he goes on, in the tone of a man
whom a very little more of this sort of treatment would disgust with
life generally, "they're making everybody abroad so English."
Then he repeats, "So English, you know," in imitation of some
American burlesque actor, and this has the effect of restoring his
good humour. He thinks the quotation so apt and so humorous,
that he expands in chuckles, and goes out of the <i>salle-à-manger</i> doing
a step, and repeating, "So English, you
know!" The French, Spanish, and the
visitors of various nationalities, shake their
heads, shrug their shoulders, and evidently
hope he is harmless. The waiters smile,
and this reassures the guests.</p>

<p>The special merit of the Royat Drinking
Waters and Baths consists in the large
amount of iron contained in them. Over the
gates of the Park at Royat, where the
<i>Etablissement</i> and <i>Buvettes</i> are situated,
should be inscribed, for the benefit of English
visitors, "Washing and Ironing done
here."</p>

<p><i>The Uncertain Bather.</i>&mdash;My acquaintance
<span class="smcap">Mordel</span> is another variety of the genus
<i>baigneur</i>. He is dissatisfied only with himself.
He is perpetually having a row with
himself. The Hotel is good enough, he says;
the Doctor is all that can be desired. The baths
and waters are managed very well; but the question is, he says to
himself, "Was I right in coming here at all? Ought I not to have
gone to Aix? or to Vichy? or to Homburg? or to Mont Dore, or to
La Bourboule?" "Well, but"&mdash;I say to him, with a view to reconciling
him to himself&mdash;"are the waters doing you good?" He
reluctantly admits that they are not doing him any harm&mdash;as yet.
In this state of uncertainty he remains during the whole course of
treatment, and, to the last, he is of opinion that he ought to have
gone to some other place, no matter where.</p>

<p>It is a real pleasure to see <span class="smcap">Smith</span>, of the Colosseum Club, meet
<span class="smcap">Brown</span>, also a member of the same sociable institution. He greets
<span class="smcap">Brown</span> heartily,&mdash;never was so glad to see anybody. Yet they are
anything but inseparables in London; and it certainly was not owing
to <span class="smcap">Smith's</span> good offices that <span class="smcap">Brown</span> was elected to the Colosseum.
<span class="smcap">Brown</span> has just arrived at Royat, and is not so effusive at the sight
of <span class="smcap">Smith</span>, as <span class="smcap">Smith</span>, who has been here ten days, is on beholding
<span class="smcap">Brown</span>. "<span class="smcap">Thompson's</span> here, so's <span class="smcap">Jones</span>," <span class="smcap">Smith</span> tells <span class="smcap">Brown</span>,
beamingly. "Are they?" returns <span class="smcap">Brown</span>, who recognises the names
as those of eminent Colosseum men. "And now," exclaims <span class="smcap">Smith</span>,
heartily, "in the evening we can have a rubber!" This was why
<span class="smcap">Smith</span> was so overjoyed at meeting <span class="smcap">Brown</span>; not because he was an old
friend, not even because he was a member of the same social set, but
because <i>he would make a fourth</i>! "You'll want a rubber," adds
<span class="smcap">Smith</span>, cajolingly. "If he does," interposes <span class="smcap">Puller</span>, in excellent
spirits this morning, "he'll have to go to Aix-les-Bains. They
don't do the <i>massage</i> here. Aix is the place for Rubbers." The
joke falls among us like a bombshell, and the group disperses, each
wondering how long <span class="smcap">Puller</span> is going to remain at Royat. His
movements may govern our own!</p>

<p>Uneventful! General <span class="smcap">Boulanger</span> has called here to-day. No,
not on me, but on a noble English poet, who is staying at the
Continental. From the portrait in the <i>Salon</i> I should have expected
a fine fellow of six feet high, rather Saxon and swaggery.
Had he resembled his portrait I should not have believed in him.
Now I do. There is hope for <span class="smcap">Boulanger</span>. He is a short man.
<span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> was a short man. "<i>Il grandira!</i>"</p>

<p><i>Encore des Pensées.</i>&mdash;"There is a time to talk, and a time to

an audience to say it
to; the other is, when
I don't feel well,
and hate everybody
equally. <span class="smcap">Puller</span>,
when high-spirited,
cannot understand
this. Undergoing
these Royat Waters,
<span class="smcap">Puller</span> and myself
are on a see-saw.
When he is up, I am
down, and <i>vice versâ</i>.
After trying to
breakfast together,
and to be mutually
accommodating,
which is done in the
most disagreeable
manner possible, we separate, on account of incompatibility of
temper. Temporarily our relations are strained. This only applies
to the morning. I want to be quiet in the morning, and detest
early liveliness. <span class="smcap">Jane</span> and myself, in future, breakfast together at
our own time, and at our own table, in a corner. (And this is

<p>By the way, what a chance of <i>réclame</i> I lost on the occasion of
<span class="smcap">Boulanger's</span> visit. It never occurred to me till too late. I ought
to have been at the front door, awaiting his departure. At
the moment of his leaving, I should have left too. Then the
report could have been spread about that I had "gone out with"
General <span class="smcap">Boulanger</span>. How astonished M. <span class="smcap">Ferry</span> would have been.
"Quite a Fairy tale for him," says <span class="smcap">Puller</span>, who wishes to exhibit

<p><i>The Twenty-Second Morning.</i>&mdash;I shall give myself three days' leave
of absence, and revisit La Bourboule and Le Mont Dore. These two
places are higher up in the mountains of Auvergne.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>La Bourboule Revisited.</i>&mdash;Very beautiful the line of country
between Royat and La Bourboule. But the latter is an out-of-the-way
place as compared with Royat, which has the great advantage
of being within a quarter of an hour's ride, or walk, of such a real
good town as Clermont-Ferrand, whereas La Bourboule and Mont
Dore are an hour-and-a-half's drive each of them from their own
station, Laqueuille, which is nothing more than a mere country
railway station, with a simple buffet, and four hours from Clermont-Ferrand,
which I suppose is the market town, and certainly the only
place of any importance to which one can go, "there and back
again," in a long day.</p>

<p>Of course the descendants of <span class="smcap">Balbus</span>, who "<i>murum ædificavit" in</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg 149]</span>
our old Latin Grammar&mdash;(Are <span class="smcap">Balbus</span> and <span class="smcap">Caius</span> still at it in the
Grammars of the present day?)&mdash;could not leave La Bourboule alone,
and villas have been springing up in every direction. Shops, too.
Already one side of a Boulevard has been commenced, represented by
half-a-dozen superior shops, one of which, it is needless to say, is a
sweet-stuff emporium, and another a Tabac. Then they've a Hotel
de Ville at La Bourboule. In our time there was only a solitary
Gendarme, in full cocked-hat and sword, who, as an official, was a
failure, but, as a playmate of the children, and a friend of the
bonnes, was a decided success. He looked well, and inspired the
stranger on his arrival. But the feeling of awe soon wore off.
Perhaps he, also, was a <i>baigneur</i>. Invalid Gendarmes might be
usefully employed in this manner, their imposing appearance at
various watering-places would inspire confidence, while they might
be benefiting their physique. Policemen could be also effectively
used in this way. "Recruiting Sergents-de-ville" they might be
called, engaged in recruiting their own health.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A storm of rain and wind swept us out of La Bourboule&mdash;we subsequently
heard that there was snow at Mont Dore&mdash;and drove us
post-haste back to Royat warmth&mdash;comparative warmth, that is, for
they were having two or three cold, rainy, and gusty days at Royat,
too, preceding the day fixed for the Eclipse. But such weather is
bearable at Royat, if you have once experienced it at La Bourboule.
The valley of Royat is fairly high up, and well sheltered; but as to
the situation of La Bourboule and Mont Dore, one may say, reversing
the quotation, "And in the highest heights a higher still!"
"Only not, by any means still," says <span class="smcap">Puller</span>, who knows the
country, and whom no inducement will lead away from Royat.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>I have mapped out a short tour by way of return from Royat,
which is at the disposition of anyone who is preparing to make
himself a <i>baigneur</i> and a <i>titulaire</i> next season.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>My <i>itinéraire</i> is this: London to Paris, taking care to travel by
the <i>Empress</i> from Dover to Calais. Inquire beforehand at the
L. C. and D. Station. Victoria. Go by the <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> Dine in Paris
at 8·30. In a forthcoming little work I contemplate benefiting the
travelling public generally with a few useful details, of which these
are only hints. Paris next morning, to Clermont-Ferrand, for
Royat. At Royat, I should naturally recommend the Hotel I know
best. This is the Continental. It may change hands next year; if
it changes hands, it changes heads at the same time, and my advice
may or may not be useful.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Stay at Royat for cure; visit&mdash;as excursions easily done in a day,
when you're in fettle&mdash;La Bourboule and Mont Dore. For all information,
ask the most civil of men, and the most obliging, the agent,
who has an office in a line with the few shops situated on the upper
terrace of the Parc. He will tell you everything&mdash;and be delighted
to do it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>By the way, when once you've settled your tour, take my advice,
and visit Messrs. <span class="smcap">Cook</span>, of Ludgate Circus. Provide yourself with
all your tickets beforehand. It will save you a heap of trouble
afterwards. Too many Cooks can't spoil your journey, as you will
take them on the "play or pay" system, and it binds you to
nothing, except, in case of not using them, a slight discount;
whereas, on the other hand, it helps the person who is at all "infirm
of purpose" to make up his mind, and keeps him to his original plan,
which any experienced traveller will agree with me in saying, is, nine
times out of ten, the wisest and best course to pursue. Of this more
anon in my forthcoming <i>parvum opus</i> on this and cognate subjects.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Royat (if you are a <i>baigneur</i>, recommended here by your Doctor)
is an easy place to get to, and to get away from. My friend <span class="smcap">Skurrie</span>,
who, immediately he has arrived at any place, passes all his time
there in consulting guide-books, maps, <i>Bradshaws</i>, <span class="smcap">Cook's</span> tourist
books, and local <i>indicateurs</i>, with a view to see how he can best get
away, comes to me with a paper full of closely-written details, and
says, "Here's my plan:&mdash;Royat, Lyon (why do we put an 's' on to
it, and make it 'Lyons?' it would be as sensible for the French to
call Liverpool 'Liverpools,' or Manchester 'Manchesters.' And why
can't the French call London 'London,' instead of 'Londres?')&mdash;then
Aix-les-Bains (for a <i>massage</i>, and an excursion or two) ... then
Geneva. This is, if you've got time to spare. If not, in a week you
can make a really refreshing tour by pushing on from Lyon to
Geneva, to Bâle, to Heidelberg, to Mainz, down the Rhine to Cologne,
then Antwerp, Flushing, Queenborough. This will complete your
week, and you will return to England with a store of variety to last
you a year."</p>

<h2>NOT A "DEUS EX MACHINÂ."</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> philosophers are very anxious to
demonstrate that man is a mere Automaton.
A man, however, can at any rate be regulated,
and, at need, "run in," which it seems that
the Automatic Cigarette and Sweetmeat
Machines now so much in vogue cannot.
Naughty little boys are convicted of beguiling
them of Butter Scotch by means of discs of
card and base metal, instead of coins of the
realm. On the other hand the Automata are
charged with absorbing the coppers of honest
would-be purchasers without rendering up
the proper portion of Toffee or Tobacco.
Machines which are at once dishonest themselves
and the cause of dishonesty in others
can hardly be looked upon as an improvement
upon living vendors, who if they have little
conscience to appeal to, have at least persons
to be punished.</p>

<h2>HYGIENIC.</h2>

<p>No; that sickly-looking child that you notice entering
the Board School is not, as you imagine, "pining for the
fresh air of the country." He is recovering from an acute
attack of scarlet fever, and is described by his fond parent
as "peeling wonderful."</p>

<p>"Why does the medical man who attends the case,"&mdash;you
ask&mdash;"not give instant notice to the Local Sanitary Authority,
the Parish Doctor, the School Board Officials, and
the nearest Fever Hospital?" Because self-preservation (or
preserving a case for oneself) is the first law of nature, and
also because in London neither the registration nor the
isolation of infectious disease is considered at all essential.</p>

<p>Of course it is to be regretted that some of the fever patients
who were taken the other day first to the West
London Hospital in Hammersmith, then to the London Fever
Hospital, and afterwards to Stockwell, and who finally&mdash;as
those institutions were quite full&mdash;spent the night in a
draughty corridor of the Homerton work-house, should have
collapsed owing to exhaustion; but then what an admirable
thing it is that there should be so many places for the reception&mdash;or
rejection&mdash;of patients, and that they should be scattered
all over the Metropolis!</p>

<p>It is really rather irritating that the laundress, whose
services we have had to dispense with owing to five of her
children being down with typhus, should call us "selfish"
and "finicking," and threaten to summon us to the Police
Court for interfering with her business.</p>

<p>Yes, a trip by steamer on the Thames can be confidently
recommended to delicate persons in search of health.
Wrap the whole face in cotton-wool, which has previously
been soaked in some powerful disinfectant. Get the man at
the wheel to sprinkle your clothing every ten minutes with
the anti-cholera mixture. When passing "Barking Outfall,"
be particularly careful to go below, and keep your
head completely buried in a basin containing a mixture of
smelling salts in solution and Eau de Cologne. Beyond a
sore throat for a week or two, you will probably&mdash;thanks to
these precautions&mdash;experience no evil results.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I think</span>, however pleased you may look in your stall while
listening to the charming music of Mr. <span class="smcap">Cellier</span> in <i>The Sultan of
Mocha</i>, you will agree with me that that gifted gentleman has been
most unfortunate in the selection of his
<i>librettos</i>. <i>Dorothy</i> was certainly feeble,
but the revived opera at the Strand is
feebler still. I admit that the work is
well staged, equally as to scenery,
dresses, and <i>mise-en-scène</i>, but the
plot and the dialogue are unworthy of
serious criticism. When the curtain
rose upon a capital "set" of the
Thames near Greenwich Hospital,
when there were a lively chorus and a
pretty dance, I imagined I was "in"
for what other occupants of the stalls
would have called "a real good thing."
But the characters had only to talk to
cause a sense of depression to envelope
me, that nearly moved me to tears.
Ponderous allusions to such recent
"topics" as Lord <span class="smcap">Charles Beresford's</span>
signal from the Royal Yacht at the
Naval Review, the <span class="smcap">Endacott</span> matter and Turkish impecuniosity now
and again attracted my attention, and I felt that I would give worlds
to slumber as does the hero in the Third Act who appropriately sings
himself to sleep. But Mr. <span class="smcap">Cellier's</span> music made a success of <i>Dorothy</i>,
and it is not impossible that "the movement may be continued" in
the <i>Sultan of Mocha</i>. Of those who take part in the performance I
may single out Mr. <span class="smcap">Charles Danby</span> as fairly amusing. I do not
remember to have seen him before, and it is to be trusted
that the applause of a London audience will not cause him to
favour a policy of exaggeration. So far he is good&mdash;not too good
(as Mr. <span class="smcap">Brough</span> was wont to amusingly observe), but just good
enough. The voice of Miss <span class="smcap">Violet Cameron</span> is as strong as
ever, but at times I traced a <i>tremolo</i> that might wisely be abandoned.
Mr. <span class="smcap">C. H. Kenney</span> has good intentions, and no doubt some
day will be seen and heard to greater advantage. I was not surprised
to learn from the playbill that as the <i>Sultan</i> Mr. <span class="smcap">Ernest
Birch</span> was making "his first appearance." Of the remainder of the
cast, Mr. <span class="smcap">Bracy</span> sang well and acted fairly as "a heart of oak," and
the sailors, villagers, and slaves were sufficiently comely to satisfy
the requirements of a Strand audience met together to enjoy an
<i>opéra bouffe</i>.</p>

<p>A new <i>lever de rideau</i> added to the programme of the Globe has
called attention to the merry moments of <i>The Doctor</i>. From the
first this piece went wonderfully well&mdash;now it goes better than ever.
The house is nightly full of patients, who seem willingly to give
themselves over to what I may call "the laughter cure and joke
treatment."</p>

<p><i>Dandy Dick</i> has moved from the Court to King William Street,
Strand. Mr. <span class="smcap">Clayton</span>, capital as the Dean, and Mrs. <span class="smcap">John Wood</span>
inimitable, exquisite, everything-superlative as the lady horse-owner.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Bishop</span> now plays Mr. <span class="smcap">Arthur Cecil's</span> part in a
manner that reduces our regret at the absence of his predecessor to a
minimum.</p>

<p>A wonderful piece called <i>Racing</i>, by the "Great <span class="smcap">Macdermott</span>," is
being performed at Islington. It is composed of a mixture of Comedy
and Tragedy. Both ingredients are equally funny.</p>

<p>Removing my <i>gibus</i>, and laying down my programmes and opera-glasses,
I again sign myself   <span class="smcap">One Who Has Gone to Pieces.</span></p>

<h2>(NOT AT ALL) BAD HOMBURG.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Travel Notes, from the Diary of Toby, M.P.</span></h3>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Homburg emptying and re-filling; but
former process decidedly winning race. Change in class
of company moreover striking. Natural order of things
here reversed. The butterfly disappears and the grub
succeeds. Now have come to us young men and maidens
from the country. Elderly burgesses, wives and families
from Frankfort, Coblentz and more distant Cologne.
Prices specially designed for English falling away.
Principal hotels humbly proffer pension at ten marks a
day, and proprietors are accused of rapacity by their
fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>At <i>table d'hôte</i> last night at Hotel Russie, overheard
one of those "things one would rather not have said,"
feigned by the fancy of English Artist of world-wide
renown. Gentleman of distinguished appearance opens
conversation with lady on his left:</p>

<p><i>He.</i> "Homburg still seems very full."</p>

<p><i>She.</i> "Yes, but they're a horrid lot now arriving compared
with those who have just left; doncha think so?"</p>

<p><i>He.</i> "Really, Madam, I cannot say, as I reached
here only this afternoon." Pause in conversation.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;There are compensations for everything.
Weather has not permanently recovered earthquake-breaking-up
on day of our arrival. Still sun occasionally
comes out, making it worth while to be on foot at
seven o'clock in the night, when the sky is an unclouded
arc of blue, and the sun sparkles on dewy grass. Pleasant
then at noon, or afternoon, to stroll about under the lindens
in the Park, still full of leaves, or to lounge in Tennis
grounds watching the play. Oftener it is cold and rainy,
and here's where philosophic mind finds its recompense.
Homburg perhaps most open-windowed town north of
Alps. On sunny days not a window in any house closed.
Every home has its piano, more or less in tune. Every
piano has its relays of players. Pianist at No. 14<span class="smcap">A</span>,
Untere Promenade, cannot help hearing pianiste next
door, and plays loud to hold the field. Next door hears
practitioner on other side, and plays louder still; so it
goes on all up and down the street. Here and there the
uproar is pierced by the shrill voice of a singer. It is the
same in the next street, and in the street after, till all
Homburg becomes a Pandemonium of piano-pounding.
Now I sit in my room, with windows closed, listening
with gratitude to the pelting rain and the soughing of
the wind through the dripping trees. All other windows
are necessarily closed, and above wind and rain is
audible undertone of universal piano-playing, like the
sound of a barrel-organ in far-off back-street. Perhaps
not quite worth while coming all the way to Homburg
for; but I like to make best of things.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;His Serene and Blind Highness still here,
dutifully taking waters, and pluckily striding forth to
complete regulation-turns. No one would guess at his
affliction, except upon close observation. A photographic
portrait of him on view in one of the Studios here, in
which he looks forth open-eyed as keenest-sighted of
his subjects; a kindly, genial, brave-hearted gentleman.
All unconscious, he is made the occasion for a little satire
on Royalty which would have delighted <span class="smcap">Thackeray</span>. To
him ladies, entering into passing conversation, curtsey;
gentlemen doff their hats; and <i>Jeames de la Pluche</i>
stands bare-headed as he hands him glass of water from
spring. It is horrible to think that <span class="smcap">Jeames</span> might, with
impunity&mdash;there being no on-lookers&mdash;shake his fist
playfully in his Royal Master's face. Hope he never
takes base advantage of his opportunities. But there is
a look in <span class="smcap">Jeames's</span> eye, as he hands the glass of water,
which melikes not.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Between one and two in afternoon of revolving
days, great centre of life in Homburg is Madame
<span class="smcap">Brahe's</span> little shop in Louisen-strasse; little only on
first glance: contains unsuspected recesses in rear,
whither surplus population flows. A model place for
light luncheon such as Dr. <span class="smcap">Deetz</span> ordains: also for English
visitors convenient exchange and mart for latest
gossip and display of newest dresses. Whilst season in
full tide, Madame <span class="smcap">Brahe's</span> painfully reminiscent of Bourse
at Paris. Evil communications have wrought proverbial
effect; Germans feared throughout Europe by reason of
their conversational shouting; but English ladies, and
some gentlemen, met for luncheon <i>chez</i> Madame <span class="smcap">Brahe</span>,
might give them odds and beat them. Three or four
girls, decently spoken at home one hopes, seated at small table here, carry on
conversation at top of voice; many small tables, and as many friendly parties;
one group not to be shouted down by a neighbour. British ladies never
acknowledge defeat; competition kept up all round, till, dazed and deafened,
the stray traveller gulps down luncheon and rushes into street.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Homburg really not Bad at all, but best part of it lies outside.
To the north are delightful walks through illimitable beech woods and pathless
pine forests. Messrs. <span class="smcap">Blanc</span>, who created the place, knew very well ruling
passion of gamester. The green tables, the sound of the roulette ball, the pattern
on the cards, and the brilliantly-lighted Casino, only ostensibly attractions for
him. What his heart desires is opportunity for communing with Nature. The
solemn silence of the beech wood, the fragrance of the pines, the modest beauty of
the wild flowers that gem the edges of the wood, are what he really hankers for.
So Messrs. <span class="smcap">Blanc</span> took surrounding country in hand; planted splendid pine woods
with delightful footpaths, with benches wooing the pensive and wearied traveller.</p>

<p>Walked to-day by devious shady ways to Friedrichsdorf, a few miles out; a
quaint old-world village of charmingly-tiled houses, straggling down a
villanously paved street. Only one street in Friedrichsdorf, but more in it than
meets the eye. Houses have way of playing hide-and-seek; you look up passage
that seems entry to back of premises, when, lo! there lurks a complete house,
with tiny casement-windows, and graciously-sloped red-tiled roof. <span class="smcap">Jessie
Collings</span> ought to know Friedrichsdorf, and Right Hon. <span class="smcap">Ritchie</span> would find
in it encouragement for Amended Allotments Bill. It is, like many other villages
hereabout, home of colony of small land-proprietors. All the rich and smiling
country that lies around is theirs. Passed them working in the fields, men and
women, comfortably dressed, sturdy, and apparently happy as day is long.
Every man has at least his three acres, many more; the cow is also there, but is
chiefly in shaft of cart or plough. As we picked way down awesome street,
Friedrichsdorf, save for few children and old men, seemed deserted village;
all able-bodied inhabitants at work in field. By-and-by, when sun goes down,
they come trooping home, tramping down stony street, a jocund throng.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Rain departed; for days in succession Homburg been at its best;
almost seems like early spring, save that we still have roses; sun shining in
cloudless sky, trees still rich in foliage; grass thick and green, with here and
there abundant crocuses. Still emptying process going on with increasing
rapidity. "Lawn tennis," writes anonymous author of <i>Miss Bayle's Romance</i>,
"has become the outdoor dissipation at Homburg, and Dutch Top the indoor
one." Only stray couples are left to frequent the courts on the tennis-ground,
and the rattle of the Dutch Top is happily silenced. Still the band plays thrice a
day. Springs go on like The Brook, and the few who are left begin to think
that, after all, Homburg more enjoyable without the crowd than with it.</p>

  <p>Chill-sea.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> Nautical Drama is not making much progress. Must go
more amongst men and things. That is the only way to gain ideas.
World full of <i>dramatis personæ</i>, who will provide their own dialogue,
if you can only find them a good part. Interview old sailor; capital
character&mdash;the very man to be "discovered drinking," (which must
have frequently occurred to him) as curtain rises. Talk to him half-an-hour,
but without hearing a single
really telling line. Half-a-crown wasted!
Pleasure-boat just "putting off,"&mdash;which
is naturally a dilatory operation&mdash;Skipper
says they are only waiting
for me. I hesitate; does Art demand
this sacrifice? Hitherto my voyages
have been chiefly confined to journeyings
in a penny steamer from Chelsea
to Lambeth. But can I reasonably
expect to become familiar with marine
matters without some actual experience?
If M. <span class="smcap">Zola</span> could go and live for weeks
down a coal-mine, surely I may trust myself in a pleasure-boat for
one short half-hour? It is only sixpence.</p>

<p>I subdue my diffidence, and embark&mdash;that is, I fall over the
stern, and stumble to the only vacant seat&mdash;a thwart in the middle.
Should have <i>preferred</i> a place nearer the gunwale.... We are off;
boat pretty full, twenty-four passengers, to crew of two boatmen and
a cornet-player. People enjoying what they call "a blow on the
jetty," wave handkerchiefs to us as we pass. Curious, this blind impulse
to wave greetings to perfect strangers&mdash;does it spring from
vague enthusiasm for humanity? Chatty old gentleman next to me
<i>will</i> talk: he tells me confidentially that it is a singular thing, but it
does so happen that he has never been on the sea without an accident
of some sort occurring,&mdash;never! There is no superstitious nonsense
about him, it seems, so he thought he would "chance it" once more.
Very creditable&mdash;but more considerate if he would chance it in a
canoe. The Cornet-player quite a cockney Arion (though nobody
thinks, somehow, of pitching him overboard). He performs
appropriate airs during trip. <i>A Life on the Ocean Wave</i>, as we
start; <i>Only a Pansy Blossom</i>, (though I don't see the precise connection
of this) as we tack; and the <i>Harbour Lights</i>, when we turn.
Somehow, this rather vulgarises the Ocean&mdash;for me. Sea fortunately
smooth: nobody at all unwell. I feel nothing&mdash;except perhaps a
growing conviction that a very young infant opposite should not be
permitted to eat a jam-puff in public. Boatmen use no nautical expressions.
Passengers lively at first, though, by time we turn, the
expression on our features, like that of young lady who wore the
wreath of roses, seems "more thoughtful than before." We are
close in now&mdash;the musician is sending round his hat. Resent this
privately, it is <i>not</i> seamanlike! In beaching, yacht swings round
with her broadside to breakers, causing sudden wave to drench the
Jonah gentleman and myself before we can disembark. He seems
rather gratified than otherwise by so apposite an illustration of his
ill-luck. The brown-eyed girl on sands watches me alight&mdash;on all
fours, dripping. Sea-trip a mistake, I feel damped rather than fired.</p>

<p><i>On the Beach again.</i>&mdash;Cheap photographers, galvanic machines,
chiropodist, tea-stalls, grim old ladies eating shrimps, as if they were
cherries, out of paper bags. Open-air
music-hall, where comic songs are
shouted from platform by dreary men in
flaxen wigs to harmonium&mdash;this always
crowded. Enjoyment at Starmouth
hearty perhaps&mdash;but hardly refined.
Constantly haunted by song from open-air
platform about "The Gurls," with
refrain describing how "they squeeze,
And they tease. And they soy, 'Oh,
what joy!'" (or perhaps it should be&mdash;"sigh,
'Oh, what jy!'") Either
way, it has hit the popular taste here.
I may be prudish&mdash;but, even if a couple <i>are</i> engaged, it seems to me
that a nicer sense of propriety would deter them from dozing in a
sand-pit, <i>coram publico</i>, with their arms around one another's
neck. Nobody thinks anything of this at Starmouth, however.</p>

<p>What a matter of circumstance are our prejudices! I should once
have thought that nothing would induce me to drive about on a
<i>char-à-banc</i>&mdash;like one of the band in a circus procession. Yet I
have just returned from a drive in one&mdash;and enjoyed it!</p>

<p>She&mdash;my brown-eyed divinity of the Phrenology lecture&mdash;was on
one of the seats, which redeemed a drive otherwise prosaic. We
went to ruined castle; scenery unpicturesque (she showed, I thought,
delicate perception of this by reading <i>Family Herald</i> all the way).
Starmouth children ran by side of carriage, turning head-over-heels,
and gasping comic songs for coppers. Had last glimpse of them
standing gratefully in a row on their heads.</p>

<p>We did not alight to see castle, as coachman said there was
nothing to see. On way home, conductor made collection on his
own account. (The hat is not much worn at Starmouth.) Yet I
was happy&mdash;I have made <i>her</i> acquaintance! Charming as she is
beautiful&mdash;so simple and <i>naïve</i> in the few remarks she made. She
is called <span class="smcap">Louise</span>, and the person I took to be her maid is, it appears,
her aunt&mdash;a most shrewd and sensible old lady, full of quiet good
sense. We became friendly at once.</p>

<p><i>A Week later.</i>&mdash;No time for notes lately&mdash;too absorbed in study of
<span class="smcap">Louise's</span> character&mdash;most complex and fascinating. Am I drifting
into love? Why not&mdash;who could help
it? The rank she occupies is not, perhaps,
a lofty one; but at least there
is nothing unfeminine in the duty of
providing old ladies and children with
light refreshment from behind the
counter of an Oxford Street confectioner.
And her tastes are refined; she
is a gentlewoman by nature and instinct.
The lady-phrenologist has
delineated her (privately), and declared
that <span class="smcap">Louise</span> "could learn science easily,
and play the piano, if she turns her
attention that way." As a matter of fact, she has not, because
neither science nor the piano is in demand at a confectioner's; but
still she undoubtedly possesses a superior intellect; no ordinary girl
would enter into the Nautical Drama, for instance, as she does.</p>

  <p>&quot;A Blow on the Jetty.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>We have been to see <i>Caste</i> at the theatre. <span class="smcap">Louise</span> very grave and
critical; she only laughed once, and that was when <i>Eccles</i> blew
rather loudly down his pipe to clear it. So many girls have an inconvenient
sense of humour&mdash;quite unsexing, I have always thought.</p>

<p>Her aunt is not precisely patrician in her manner, which would be
totally out of place in a Fancy Wool Repository&mdash;but, after all, I
shall not have to go through any experiences like poor <i>D'Alroy's</i>.
And I am sure my uncle's heart will warm to <span class="smcap">Louise</span> at once. Why
hesitate, then? I will not.</p>

<p>I have taken the plunge&mdash;<span class="smcap">Louise</span> has consented. She tells me
that she was won by my appearance in the Professor's chair, and
still more by the character he gave me. How our choicest blessings
masquerade! Drama, for the moment, in the background&mdash;but
only apparently so. Literature has no stimulus like love, and I am
constantly talking the play over with <span class="smcap">Louise</span>. She has made one
suggestion that convinces me she has a keen sense of dramatic effect&mdash;a
hornpipe in one of the Acts. I am to read her the first Scene, as
soon as it is put into shape.</p>

<p>Her brother "<span class="smcap">Alf</span>" is expected down to-night. <span class="smcap">Louise</span> is certain
we shall "take to one another," he has "such spirits," and is "quite
a cure." Always thought a "cure" was a kind of jumping clown&mdash;but
<span class="smcap">Alf</span> is a clerk in a leading establishment, somewhere in
Marylebone&mdash;a steady, industrious young fellow, no doubt. However,
I shall meet him to-morrow.</p>

<p>I <i>have</i> met <span class="smcap">Alf</span>. Although I love <span class="smcap">Louise</span> with the first real
passion of a lifetime, I cannot disguise from myself that her brother
is an unmitigated Blazer. I would almost rather that he did not take
to me&mdash;but he does. In half an hour he is addressing me as "Old
gooseberry-pudden." If he is going to do this often, I shall have to
hint that I do not like it.</p>

<p>I have been strolling with him on the sands, where he has already
found several of his acquaintance. He <i>will</i> introduce me to all of
them. Hearty, high-spirited fellows, full of rough but genuine
British humour. From the manner in which they all inquire "How
my bumps are getting on," I infer they were amongst Professor
<span class="smcap">Skittles</span>' audience the other day. But they mean to be friendly
enough&mdash;I must not let them see how they annoy me.... It is
absurd to be stiff at Starmouth.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
